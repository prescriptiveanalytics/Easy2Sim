# Easy2Sim


## Description
Easy2Sim is a open source C# simulation framework developed by the RISC Software GmbH. The goal of this framework is, that it allows fast development of simulation libraries and a good connection to other programs. Currently the framework support [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_simulation) and [discrete-event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-event_simulation) simulation. By default the framework runs deterministically, however, stochastic simulations are possible.

The simulation framework has been build by the RISC Software GmbH in the [Secure Prescriptive Analytics project](https://www.prescriptiveanalytics.at/).
